Component testing is also known as module and program testing. It finds the defects in the module and verifies the functioning of software. Component testing is done by the tester or a Quality Assurance(QA) Engineer. Component testing may be done in isolation from rest of the system depending on the development life cycle model chosen for that particular application.
